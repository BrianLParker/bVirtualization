# bVirtualization
This is a Blazor component for Virtualization that supports infinite scrolling with ANY type of data source, whether it's an API or Database or just simply a file on your computer or just in memory!


## Summary
This is a Blazor Library to provide engineers with Blazor UI components that enables them to develop software with infinite scrolling capabilities.

The main idea here is to provide a datasource-agnostic component that may be integrated and plugged in with any back-end supporting capability for providing data in the most seamless and easy way possible.

One of the fundamental purposes of this component to close the gap between the WASM client and whatever datasource that the component can integrate with with something as simple as three lines of code or less.

Ideally, this product is built to improve the engineering experience for developing UI components in Blazor.
